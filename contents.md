Infrastructure Engineer

[NOTE]
I currently work for Bloomberg as an infrastructure engineer. I help design
and build the low-level systems that keep financial data moving to the right
places.

My role is essentially a hybrid between a software engineer, architect and
data scientist. I dabble in a bit of everything basically!
