Infrastructure Engineer

_note_
I currently work for Bloomberg as an infrastructure engineer. I help design
and build the low-level systems that keep financial data moving to the right
places.

My role is essentially a hybrid between a software engineer, architect and
data scientist. I dabble in a bit of everything basically!

Applied machine learning in:

* network security
* enterprise software management
* employment

_note_
I've applied machine learning to

increase global network security

assist organisations maintain their large, enterprise software estates

and more recently, I've consulted for recruitment startup helper.io

## What is Deep Learning?

[NEXT]
### Machine Learning

An approach to achieve artificial intelligence

Allows machines to **learn** behaviour with little human intervention

Programs that can **adapt** when exposed to new data

Based on **pattern recognition**

_note_
Machine learning has been around for a long time, but industry adoption and
academic research has grown rapidly the past five to ten years.

It's now being used in:

education
security
robotics
finance
speech recognition
image recognition
advertising
(even brewing!)

### Modern Uses of Deep Learning

Widely used in image recognition

TODO: examples (driver-less cards and two others)

### Other Factors

* cheaper computing power and data storage
* more data than ever &dash; everyone is online

#### Projected Deep Learning Software Revenue

Placeholder<!-- .element id="deep-learning-growth-chart" -->

[NEXT]
> Annual revenue for deep learning will surpass **$10 billion** by 2014

_note_
The market intelligence firm forecasts that annual software revenue for
enterprise applications of deep learning will increase from $109 million
in 2015 to $10.4 billion in 2024.

I suspect this large growth is because of deep learning's application in
driver-less cars, which is going to become a *huge* industry.
